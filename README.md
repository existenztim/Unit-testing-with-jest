# Test assignment - unittest with jest

    In this assignment I was given pre written TypeScript code that I needed to
    make unittest on. I learned how to set up an test environment with jest and
    the basics of "expect","spies" and code-coverage.

## Code coverage

    Code coverage at the time speaking is 91.22%.
